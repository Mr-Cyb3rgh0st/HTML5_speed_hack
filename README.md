## 🚀 Features

- **Main World Injection**: Unlike other extensions, this hooks directly into the browser's core functions (`performance.now`, `Date.now`, `setTimeout`, etc.) for maximum compatibility.
- **Granular Speed Control**: Adjust the speed from 0.001x to 100x (and beyond using custom inputs).
- **Individual Function Toggling**: Toggle separate hooks for:
  - `performance.now()`
  - `Date.now()`
  - `setTimeout`
  - `setInterval`
  - `requestAnimationFrame`
  - 🎵 **Music** and 🔊 **Sound FX** speed control.
- **Floating UI Overlay**: A premium, draggable UI with smooth transitions and glassmorphism.
- **Extension Toggle**: Open/close the UI by clicking the extension icon in your toolbar.
- **Hotkey Support**: Press **L** to quickly hide/show the UI.
- **Persistence**: Remembers your settings across page reloads.
